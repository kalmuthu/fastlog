doxygen
- add doxygen support for this project.
- document the fastlog interface.
- add master (long) documentation to doxygen.
- publicize the documentation for this somewhere (wiki on github ?!?).

performance:
currently it looks like file operations take 0.4 mic and copy (mine) take 0.3.
This is wrong since in my case there is no variance and in the file case there
is variance since the file case which uses user land buffers in most cases there
is a copy and in some cases OS call.

What to do about it?
In the test get the variance as well as the time. (min and max). This way I could
show that mine is better.

How to do it?
More accurate measurements. Get it via RDTSC.

In stages:
- create a program that prints the stability of the RDTSC.
	historgram until the user presses something.
- use that program to make sure that the RDTSC is stable.
- now measure my method calls using the RDTSC and not using gettimeofday.
