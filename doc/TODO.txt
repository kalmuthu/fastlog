- move this project over to github.
- add the test that I have in my demos to this project.
		(syslog_speed.cc).
- add doxygen support for this project.

performance:
currently it looks like file operations take 0.4 mic and copy (mine) take 0.3.
This is wrong since in my case there is no variance and in the file case there
is variance since the file case which uses user land buffers in most cases there
is a copy and in some cases OS call.

What to do about it?
In the test get the variance as well as the time. (min and max). This way I could
show that mine is better.
