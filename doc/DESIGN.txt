Fast log is a C/C++ logging library.

Why would you want to use it?
Because it is faster than any other logging library for C and C++ and is better
for performing logging for real time applications.

fastlog works using shared memory and is built on the assumption that the most crucial
part of logging is the time it takes the logger code to log a message. The logger may
be a real time thread and so the log action itself should take the minimal time possible.

Timing:
=======
syslog(3) calls time(2) every time you call it to record the original time of the message. This library does not do this since time(2) is a system call and hence too expensive for
this logging library to use. There is an option to send the RDTSC instead (which is a register accessible quite fast from user space). However, this is an Intel feature only. If you know of similar features on other hardware platforms, please submit patches.

Langugage:
==========
C was selected since this library should be usable from any C program.

syslog compatibility:
=====================
This library should be a stand in for the syslog API (meaning that any program that
uses syslog should be able to use it as it).
